       <li>Incantation <img src="https://www.grimoireofhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Incantation.jpg" alt=""></li>
       <p>This Netflix's lastest movie is a Kevin ko's slow burn Taiwanese found footage horror film.
       This movie comes from the roots of Taiwan.It has so much going for it.Even the fact that this is actually a <b><em>"found footage"</em></b>movie works.It is Really good!
       What one can call Eerie,Creepy and Bloody at the same time. This film mainly concentrates on the traditions of a <b><em>curse</em></b> that gets passed on,ancient rituals performed in a remote region of th mountains,a recurring symbol and an eerie invocation to a <b><em>faceless deity</em></b>
       So,if you are into a mood to watch something refreshing in horror this is the movie to go for undoubtedly.
       <b>RATE</b>:8/10

      <p>Orphan first kill is the horro Prequel of the original horror hit<b><em>"Orphan"</em></b>
       A continuation of the story of Esther. This follows the story of an Estonian asylum escapes and passes herself off as Esther Albright,missing daughter of a well to do American Family.
       However her new home in the United States is threathened,she resorts to murder.
       <b>RATE</b>:6.5/10

       <li>Room 203 <img src="https://www.grimoireofhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/room-203-film-review.jpg" alt=""></li>
       <p>Based on a Japanese novel by writer Nanami Kamon and made with the participation of Japanese producers, I was expecting Room 203 to be yet another Anglicised J-horror in the mould of The Grudge but thatâ€™s not exactly what we get. Whilst yes, there may be some elements of J-horror for the most part this is a traditional haunted house movie. Only a hunted house movie that spends a LOT of its running time concentrating on the relationship between the two protagonists. Two broken, fragile women who both bring a lot of baggage to their new co-habiting life.
        <b>RATE</b>:7/10
